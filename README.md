🛒 Add to Cart Website
This is a simple and interactive Add to Cart functionality built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project demonstrates how to dynamically add items to a shopping cart, update item count, calculate the total price, and toggle the visibility of the cart sidebar.

📂 How It Works
Products are displayed on the page with an "Add to Cart" button.

When a button is clicked:

The item is cloned or added to the cart section.

The cart counter is updated.

The total price is recalculated.

Clicking the cart icon opens a sliding cart sidebar.

Items can be removed individually (optional, if you’ve implemented this).

The cart panel can be closed using a close (×) icon.
